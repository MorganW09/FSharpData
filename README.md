# FSharpData
A project demonstrating how to call a F# data layer from a C# context. 

This was written and tested in dotnet core 2.2 on a Windows 10 machine running Visual Studio 2019. There's a postman collection in the root of this repository that will allow you to test out the api endpoints. Ensure that the connection string specified in the Startup.cs is valid on your machine.
